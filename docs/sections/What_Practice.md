## What Do We Mean by “Practice”?

Practice is:
1. A habit  
2. A routine  
3. Does not need to be remembered consciously  
4. Comes through repetition  
5. Requires dedication and commitment  

One of the most important attributes of practice is its ability to keep you from diverging from what you’re accustomed to doing. This means that when a practice becomes ingrained, it ensures consistency and reliability. For software developers, this is particularly significant: adopting and internalizing best practices allows you to produce clean, maintainable code effortlessly.

Practice ensures that actions become second nature. Just as a skilled driver no longer consciously thinks about every step required to operate a car, a developer following best practices can focus on solving problems and delivering value without being distracted by the mechanics of clean coding.
