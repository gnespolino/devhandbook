## The Source Code

### What is the source code?

The source code is much more than just a plain text file. It serves at least three key purposes:
1. A way to instruct a machine to execute actions.  
2. A **source of KNOWLEDGE**.  
3. A medium for developers to communicate their thoughts with other developers.  

While the first point is straightforward and widely understood, this section focuses on the other two. Code quality becomes meaningful when we view source code as a source of knowledge and a communication tool among developers.

Source code reflects the developer's thought process. Keeping it **clean**, **consistent**, and **structured** not only helps ensure high quality but also makes it easier for others to read and understand.

Shared coding standards are essential. Without them, if each developer uses their own style or changes conventions frequently, communication becomes difficult, and understanding each otherâ€™s code gets unnecessarily complex. Recognizing that code is a form of communication leads us to an important principle:

### Code should be written to be read (and reviewed)

Code is not just a tool for machines; it is also a powerful medium for developers to communicate. When we write code, we are not only instructing a machine but also expressing our thought process in a way that others (or even our future selves) can understand.

Code serves two primary audiences:
1. **Ourselves**: When revisiting code weeks or months later, we rely on its clarity to quickly grasp the logic and purpose behind it.  
2. **Other developers**: Whether itâ€™s for collaboration, maintenance, or code review, the readability of code directly impacts how effectively others can work with it.

For these reasons, code should always be written with the expectation that it will be read, reviewed, and understood by others. When writing code, ask yourself:
- Is this clear enough for someone unfamiliar with the project to follow?  
- Does it communicate my intent without requiring additional explanations?  

**Writing code with the reader in mind not only improves collaboration but also elevates the overall quality and maintainability of the project.**

### Why Code Review Matters

At first, code reviews might feel like criticism. Itâ€™s normal to feel uneasy when someone points out mistakes, such as deviations from standards, poor naming conventions, or other issues. However, feedback should be embraced as a valuable opportunity to grow.

Code reviews are **not** about undermining co-workers. Instead, they provide a chance to:
- Help each other grow.
- Share knowledge effectively.
- Strengthen the project by distributing code responsibility.

Key benefits of code reviews include:
1. Faster skill improvement for all team members.  
2. Exposure to new coding techniques and approaches.  
3. Building a stronger team where code ownership is shared.  
4. Preventing bugs in production, leading to fewer fixes and more time for building features.  

As [Jono Herrington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jono-herrington/) insightfully [explains](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jono-herrington_code-reviews-are-destroying-your-team-culture-activity-7272943291858337792-yhqg):

> "Code reviews are destroying your team culture. Here's why:  
> 
> 1. Nitpicking kills motivation  
> 2. Perfect is the enemy of shipping  
> 3. Ego battles waste energy  
> 4. Comments replace conversations  
> 5. Junior devs fear pushing code  
> 
> The truth: Code reviews should build teams, not break spirits."

He goes on to highlight how to review code properly:  
> 1. Focus on impact, not style  
> 2. Have conversations, not arguments  
> 3. Teach, don't criticize  
> 4. Praise good patterns  
> 5. Make it safe to be wrong."

These principles remind us that great code reviews are not just about improving codeâ€”they are about improving teams. A constructive, collaborative review process helps developers build trust, confidence, and the desire to grow together.  

> "Great teams build each other up, not tear each other down."
