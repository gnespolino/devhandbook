# Developer Handbook
### Practices, Principles, and Philosophy for the Modern Backend Engineer

Welcome to the **Developer Handbook**. This repository is a living collection of best practices, architectural patterns, and software engineering philosophy. It is curated to help developers write cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.

## About the Author

Hi, I'm **Giuseppe Nespolino**.

I am a **Senior Software Engineer** and Backend Specialist based in Málaga, Spain. With over 15 years of experience in the field, I have architected and built scalable systems for industries ranging from Health Tech (Open Source) to Fintech and Gaming.

My career has been defined by a passion for **Clean Code**, **Open Source**, and **Linux** systems. I have contributed extensively to global projects like **DHIS2** (the world's largest health information system), optimized high-traffic betting platforms, and implemented blockchain analytics solutions.

I believe that software engineering is a craft. It requires not just technical knowledge of Java, Spring Boot, or Microservices, but a disciplined approach to simplicity, readability, and architectural integrity.

## Why This Handbook?

In my experience mentoring teams and leading technical projects, I've realized that the hardest part of software development isn't the syntax—it's the **mindset**.

This handbook serves as:
1.  **A Knowledge Base:** A reference for SOLID principles, Design Patterns, and Architecture.
2.  **A Communication Tool:** A shared standard to align teams on "how we do things here."
3.  **A Manifesto:** A plea for simplicity in an increasingly complex tech landscape.

> *"Hazlo simple o no lo hagas."* (Keep it simple or don't do it.)
